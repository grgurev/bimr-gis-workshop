### Lab 2 - Getting to know Git and Github
#### Objective - explore and understand Git and Github workflow

---

**1. Introduction**
In this exercise you will explore and understand Git workflow by using Git and Github. **Git** is Distributed (Decentralized) version control system that is widely used by a number of open source projects and by many programmers to help them implement complex coding projects. **Github** is popular website that lets user store a copy of git repository online where other collaborators can share it and work together. 
This exercise includes the following tasks:

Task 1 – Install GitHub desktop software and create user account at GiHub.
Task 2 – Get familiar with look and feel on the GitHub website.
Task 3 – Synchronize the workshop repo with new changes.

**2. Objective: explore and understand Git and Github workflow**

**Task 1: Install and get familiar with Git.**
In this task you will become familiar with Git. 
The first step is to setup Git project. You can get a Git project using two main approaches: 

* first takes an existing project or directory and imports it into Git;
* second clones an existing Git repository from another server. 

For this task, workshop project is already created on GitHub so you will use second approach, that is to clone existing repository from a GitHub server.
But, before cloning repository we need to install Git software. Here we also have two approaches:

* for users that are already familiar with Git, recommended approach would be to install command line version which is available from [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/). 
* for beginners, the second approach is recommended, that is to install Git as a part of GitHub desktop software [https://desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com) which is a GUI version of Git software.

**Steps to do:**
1. Go to [https://desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com) and install GitHub desktop for your operating system.
2. Start GitHub desktop and create your account on [https://github.com](https://github.com) if you already don't have it.
3. Enter login credentials to connect Github desktop with your GitHub account.
4. Configure Git settings.
5. Clone the workshop repository from [https://github.com/grgurev/bimr-gis-workshop.git](https://github.com/grgurev/bimr-gis-workshop.git).

**Task 2: Get familiar with GitHub.**
Now when you finished installing all of the required software, go to the repository web address at [https://github.com/grgurev/bimr-gis-workshop](https://github.com/grgurev/bimr-gis-workshop) and check out our workshop repo. All GitHub repositories live at github.com/[[username]]/[[repo-name]].

There is a lot of information on this page; some of it you'll find useful, and some of it you can safely ignore as a non-programmer.

**Steps to do:**
1. Find out the full name of the repo.
2. Find out how many commits have been made.
3. Find out how many people have contributed to the project.
4. Find out what happens if you click on a file in a file list?
5. Find out if any issues have been issued for the repo?

**Task 3: Synchronize the workshop repo with new changes.
